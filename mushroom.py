"""
The fly's own learning circuit.

Everything else in this project runs the connectome forward with fixed
weights. This is the one place a weight is allowed to change, and it changes
where a fly's weights actually change: the Kenyon cell (KC) to mushroom body
output neuron (MBON) synapse, under dopamine.

THE RULE (direction measured in flies, constants chosen)
A KC that was active shortly before dopamine arrives has that KC-to-MBON
synapse depressed, not strengthened (Hige et al. 2015, Cohn et al. 2015).
Learning in a fly is subtraction: the mushroom body starts able to drive every
response and experience carves away some of them. So there is no potentiation
here, only depression with a floor, and a drift back toward baseline over
wall-clock time that stands in for forgetting.

WHICH MBONS GET WHICH DOPAMINE (counted from the synapse table)
build/mb_sides.json, written by mb_sides.py, counts the synapses each MBON type
receives from PAM and from PPL1 dopamine neurons and puts the type on the side
that gives it more input. The simulator's weight matrix cannot answer this:
build_graph.py gives dopamine synapses sign 0 and drops them.

An earlier version of this file compared MBON output onto PAM and PPL1 instead
of their input. That put 14 of 37 MBON types on the wrong side, so reward and
punishment each landed partly in the other's compartments. Gains learned under
that split live in mb_gains.npz and are never read (see STORE).

WHAT THE SIDES MEAN FOR BEHAVIOUR
Reward dopamine (PAM) depresses KC input to PAM-compartment MBONs, which drive
avoidance. Punishment dopamine (PPL1) depresses KC input to PPL1-compartment
MBONs, which drive approach (Aso et al. 2014, eLife 3:e04580; measured for the
MBONs they tested, assumed for the rest). calibration.readout() reads them that
way.

WHAT IS HONEST ABOUT THIS AND WHAT IS NOT
* The circuit, the plasticity site and the direction of the rule are real.
* The reward signal is not. A real fly is rewarded by sugar and punished by
  shock. In the backroom, profit arrives as reward dopamine and loss as
  punishment dopamine. People chose that pairing.
* Learning is partly global: a lesson about one smell also shifts the response
  to similar smells (calibration.py and build/backroom_screen.json).
* The learning rate, floor, eligibility decay and memory half-life are chosen.
