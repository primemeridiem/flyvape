"""
The backrooms world: one room, two flies, three channels between them, and
the coupling from each fly's senses to one shared connectome and back to its
legs.

Why this file exists. The backrooms page shows two copies of the male CNS
connectome walking in a 20 x 20 mm arena, each seeing, smelling and hearing
the other. Nothing here decides anything and nothing here writes a word: this
module turns geometry into spike rates on the sensory neurons that carry those
signals in a real fly, runs the brain for one window, and turns the descending
neurons' rates back into a turn and a speed with the roamer's conversions. The
transcript and the page are other files; they read the numbers this one
records.

MEASURED (this connectome, build/graph.npz; counts checked in this session)
  * ORN_DA1, the cVA receptor neurons: 204 cells. JO-A: 50 cells, JO-B: 89
    cells (the sound-sensitive Johnston's organ classes). Pulse-song wing
    motor neurons (ps1, i1, iii1, b3 MN): 8 cells. The roamer's motor types:
    DNa02 2, DNa01 2, MDN 4, DNp09 2. L1 1,776 and L2 1,779 lamina cells, of
    which pumpui.FlyEye keeps those with a hex column. The groups themselves
    are resolved by backrooms_dictionary, which cites each identity.
  * pumpui.FlyEye.look samples a 300 x 210 px window at the gaze point onto
    the hex columns, L1 at lum x 180 Hz and L2 at (1 - lum) x 108 Hz.
  * One 60-step window of flysim.FlyBrain is 60 x 0.2 ms = 12 ms of brain
    time, so every per-cell rate is a multiple of 83.3 Hz.

CHOSEN (every number below is a choice, disclosed by describe())
  * The room: 20 x 20 mm, a courtship-chamber scale (real assays use 10-30 mm
    chambers). World step 50 ms. Walking up to 20 mm/s, turning up to 360
    deg/s; the command is clipped to [-1, 1] and scales those. The fly turns,
    then walks along its new heading. Walls clamp the position. Starts are
    drawn from the seed inside a 2 mm margin.
  * Sight: a 1280 x 800 grey frame of the ground at 0.5 with the other fly
    as an ellipse at 0.0, so a lamina column on the ground gets L1 90 Hz /
    L2 54 Hz and one on the fly L1 0 / L2 108 Hz. (The first draft used a
    ground of 0.05: L1 9 vs 0 Hz, and the measured 15-minute run showed the
    other fly changing the retina's mean input by 0.2 Hz, i.e. no signal;
    the ground was raised so the ellipse has contrast.) The 300 px eye
    window at the frame centre spans the 180 deg in front of the fly (1.667
    px per degree), so a fly behind the viewer is drawn in the frame but not
    in the window: the fly looks where it faces. The image x axis is the
    viewer's right; a fly on the viewer's left appears left of centre.
    Vertical position and size come from ground-plane geometry with the eye
    1.0 mm above the floor and a body of 2.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 mm; the projected
    width follows the other's heading relative to the line of sight (side-on
    shows the length, head-on the width). Each semi-axis is floored at one
    lamina-column spacing, so the other fly always covers a few columns and
    cannot fall between the eye's point samples at long range. pumpui.FlyEye
    samples one pixel per column, and both optic lobes carry the same hex
    coordinates in this dataset (875 of 875 left L1 columns coincide with
    right ones; FlyEye normalises them together), so the two retinas sample
    the same window and nothing here is a left-eye versus right-eye
    difference. MEASURED: the eye's 1,767 L1 cells therefore sample 892
    distinct positions, 9.0 px apart over the 300 x 210 window
    (column_spacing_px(892)); build_room counts the distinct positions of
    the eye it has, not its cells (counting cells gave 6.4 px in the first
    run after this change, an underestimate, since coincident columns
    sample the same pixel). Room.sight_check() measures,
    through the eye the room has, how many columns the ellipse covers at
    each distance and the retinal rates on and off it; describe() carries
    the result. MEASURED with this eye: the other fly dead ahead covers 228
    L1 columns at 2 mm side-on, 38 at 5 mm and 14 at 20 mm (the floor), at
    L1 90 vs 0 Hz per column; in the 50-world-second run after the change,
    LC10a's mean rate was 0.60 Hz with the other fly in the window against
    0.31 Hz without (A) and 0.48 against 0.38 (B), correlation +0.06 / +0.04
    over 994 steps: the retina now carries the signal and LC10a shows a
    weak association with it, not an established pursuit response. None of
    this is a measured optical model of the compound eye.
  * Smell: ORN_DA1 on fly X is driven at 200 Hz x clip(1 - d / 20 mm, 0, 1)
    by the other fly's presence (males carry cVA; DoOR has no cVA entry, so
    the receptor ceiling of Hallem and Carlson 2006 is used directly).
  * Per-side equalisation of smell and sound (v2): the driven antennal
    groups are unevenly split between the antennae by rootSide (ORN_DA1 R
    105 / L 51 with 48 unsided; JO-A L 18 / R 32; JO-B L 60 / R 29), so one
    uniform per-cell rate would deliver 2.06x the cVA cell-Hz to the right
    antenna and 1.28x the song cell-Hz to the left at every step, a lateral
    signal unrelated to where the other fly is (the first 15-minute run did
    exactly that, undisclosed). Each cell's rate is therefore the nominal
    rate x (mean count per side / its own side's count), per group, as
    plume_fly.side_scales does for wind; unsided cells get the nominal
    rate. Both antennae then receive the same total cell-Hz and the drive
    carries no side information by construction. The nominal rate is what
    the record and the transcript report as the drive; the per-cell scales
    are in FlyBody.describe()["side_scales"]. MEASURED after the change, in
    the room: the mean DNa02 R - L fell from +229 / +134 Hz (A / B, first
    run, uniform) to +88 / +52 Hz (50 world seconds, equalised, ground grey
    also changed), so the room's steering bias shrank but did not vanish.
    MEASURED in a control with NO lateral input (blank ground frame, smell
    68 Hz and sound 40 Hz nominal held constant, 150 windows per body,
    seeds 3 and 4): equalised, A +314 and B -313 Hz (se 22 each), equal and
    opposite; uniform, A +38 and B -12 Hz. Under constant symmetric input
    one DNa02 cell can ignite and stay on, on a side set by the body's seed
    and carried state, so the steering readout is dominated by the brain's
    own persistent dynamics; the remaining bias in the room is not
    explained by the antennal split, and no behavioural link between the
    delivered sound and the turning is established here.
  * Sound: fly X's song is the summed rate of its pulse-song wing motor
    neurons. The other fly's JO-A and JO-B cells (equalised per side as
    above) are driven at 200 Hz x clip(song / song_full, 0, 1) x clip(1 -
    d / 20 mm, 0, 1), where song_full is the summed rate when every song cell fires at the
    model's own ceiling, 1000 / 2.2 ms refractory = 454.5 Hz per cell: 8
    cells give 3,636 Hz. The first draft used 240 Hz (8 cells at a real
    fly's 30 pulses/s); the real-brain check measured summed rates of
    1,250-3,750 Hz under this simulator's ignition, so that reference was
    saturated on every step and carried no song information. A 12 ms window
    can realise up to 6 spikes per cell (500 Hz), so the clip can still
    engage. Sound is heard one world step late: both brains run in turn on
    one graph, so each hears the song the other sang in the previous window.
  * Brain window: 60 LIF steps (12 ms) per 50 ms world step, the brain's
    state (membrane potentials, refractory counters, rng) carried per fly, so
    the two flies alternate on one loaded graph with two state vectors. Gains
    are the roamer's calibration (calibration.CHOSEN). Learning is off: no
    dopamine is delivered anywhere in this file.
  * Motor: the roamer's mapping, unchanged, through plume_fly's
    motor_from_rates: turn = (DNa02_R - DNa02_L) / 450, forward = mean(DNa01)
    / 450, back = MDN / 450, stop = DNp09 / 450, speed = clip(forward - back)
    x (1 - clip(stop)). turn > 0 is a right turn.

Swapping the brain class (a GPU port with the same run() contract) is the
one line BRAIN_CLASS below; nothing else in this file knows which class it
holds.

The server (backrooms.py section 2) steps a World, at the end of this file:
the room behind the loop's flat per-fly record shape. World(seed) loads the
brain; World(seed, room=...) wraps a ready room, which is how the tests run
it on a fake brain.
