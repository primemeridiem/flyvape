"""
A wind tunnel with an odour plume in it, for a walking fly. Pure numpy, no brain.

This is the world half of the plume-tracking experiment (after Alvarez-Salvado
et al. 2018 eLife and van Breugel and Dickinson 2014 Curr Biol): a rectangular
arena, a uniform wind, a Gaussian-puff plume that meanders so the odour comes
and goes, and a point fly that walks and turns. The brain never sees this
module directly; the coupling layer reads concentration and wind direction out
of a World, drives the connectome, and feeds the motor rates back into step().

MEASURED (from the literature, not tuned here)
  * Walking flies track plumes by surging upwind on an odour encounter and
    casting crosswind after losing it (Alvarez-Salvado et al. 2018), and wind
    direction is read as the difference between the two antennae (Suver et al.
    2019). The world only has to make encounters and losses happen.

CHOSEN, every one of them named in CONSTANTS below so a report can print them
  * Arena 0.6 m by 0.3 m, wind 0.12 m/s toward +x, source at (0.05, 0.15) so
    upwind is -x. Walls clamp the fly and count the contacts.
  * Puffs are released from the source every 0.05 s, advected downwind at the
    wind speed, and spread as r(t) = sqrt(r0^2 + 2 D t) with D set so the plume
    is 0.06 m wide (two standard deviations) 0.3 m downwind.
  * Meander: one Ornstein-Uhlenbeck crosswind velocity (sd 0.02 m/s, time
    constant 1 s) lives at the release point. Each puff is launched with the
    crosswind velocity in force at its release and keeps it, so consecutive
    puffs fan out in correlated directions and the plume snakes downwind. A
    spatially uniform gust that moves every airborne puff at once would be the
    other common choice; this one was picked because the fan makes the plume
    genuinely intermittent at a fixed point 0.3 m downwind.
  * Concentration is the sum over puffs of q / (2 pi r^2) exp(-d^2 / (2 r^2)),
    with q calibrated once, numerically, so a straight (meander-free) plume
    reads 1.0 on the centreline 0.1 m downwind. The odour drive uses
    clip(c, 0, 1), so the ORNs saturate near the source.
  * The plume is warmed up for 6 s before the trial clock starts (longer than
    the 4.6 s it takes a puff to cross the arena), so the fly starts in an
    established plume instead of an empty tunnel. The design text says
    nothing about a warm-up; this one was chosen before any data, and its
    consequence (below) was noticed only in review after the first run.
  * Fly: dt = 0.05 s per step (one 12 ms brain run stands for 50 ms of world
    time, the roamer's convention), top speed 0.02 m/s, top turn rate 180 deg/s.
  * Trial: start at x = 0.45 (0.4 m downwind of the source), y uniform in
    [0.10, 0.20], heading uniform, 400 steps (20 s) or until within 0.03 m of
    the source. That is protocol "v1", the published run, and World(seed)
    still reproduces it byte for byte.
  * Protocol "v2" start rule (World(seed, protocol="v2"); fixed before any v2
    trial, removing two confounds the v1 report named as follow-up work):
    x = 0.25, i.e. 0.20 m downwind of the source, so a straight upwind walk
    to the reach radius needs 8.5 s of the 20 s (42.5 % of top speed) instead
    of 92.5 %; y uniform on [0.03, 0.07] or [0.23, 0.27], the side chosen at
    random, so the fly is at least 0.08 m off the centreline (3.2 sd of the
    meander-free plume there); heading uniform. One uniform draw gives both
    the side and the position in the band and one gives the heading, the
    same two draws v1 spends on y and heading, so the meander stream and
    therefore the plume of a given seed are identical under both protocols.
    Everything else (arena, wind, plume, warm-up, dt, speeds, trial length,
    reach radius) is unchanged.

CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE CHOICES (arithmetic, not results; disclosed so a reader
of the outputs does not mistake them for properties of the brain)
  * The v2 start is outside the MEANDER-FREE plume (0.004 at the inner band
    edge against the 0.05 threshold) but the meander can swing the plume
    toward a wall by a few centimetres, and on some seeds it has done so at
    t = 0. MEASURED with start_rule_v2_check(): 9 of the first 50 seeds
    (seeds 0, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 32, 38, 47) start above the threshold, the
    worst at 0.47 (seed 24). The rule was fixed before this was measured and
    is kept as fixed; the runner reports the count instead of discarding or
    re-drawing, so v2's "encounters" are onsets from clean air on the other
    seeds and the record says which ones they are not.
  * "42.5 % of top speed" is the upwind leg alone. The v2 start is also
    0.08-0.12 m off the centreline, so the straight line to the reach radius
    is hypot(0.20, offset) - 0.03 = 0.185-0.203 m, i.e. 9.3-10.2 s at top
    speed (46-51 %); a fly that only walks upwind passes the source and
    stops at the upwind wall. Reaching the source needs some crosswind
    travel as well, which is the point of the offset.
  * The source is only just reachable. The fly must cover 0.45 - 0.05 - 0.03
    = 0.37 m in 20 s at a top speed of 0.02 m/s: 18.5 s of straight upwind
    walking at full speed, 92.5 % of what the trial allows. Any hesitation or
    turning makes the source unreachable, so "source reached" is not a
    discriminating test under these constants (REACH_MIN_S, REACH_MIN_SPEED).
  * The start band is inside the plume. On the meander-free plume the
    concentration at x = 0.45 is 0.52 on the centreline and 0.18 at the band
    edges y = 0.10 and 0.20 (start_band_straight_plume()), all above the 0.05
    threshold the metrics use, and the plume's 1-sd half-width there is about
    0.035 m. With the warm-up the fly is therefore born in odour on most
    seeds; encounters and losses in a trial are the meander sweeping over a
    fly that walks about 0.1 m in 20 s, not the fly finding the plume. A
    future preregistration would start the fly outside two sd of the
    centreline, or further downwind, and give it time to reach the source.

SIGN CONVENTIONS (stated once, used everywhere)
  * heading is in radians, counter-clockwise from +x. A fly heading into the
    wind (toward -x) has heading pi.
  * turn > 0 turns RIGHT (clockwise, heading decreases), matching the roamer's
    (R - L) / 450 readout where a positive value is a right turn.
  * wind_direction_relative(heading) is the angle the wind comes FROM relative
    to the heading, wrapped to (-pi, pi]: 0 is a headwind, +pi/2 is wind from
    the fly's LEFT (the fly heading +y, wind from -x), -pi/2 from its right.

Everything is deterministic under the seed: the fly's start pose, then the
meander noise, come from one numpy Generator in a fixed order, and the plume is
simulated identically whether odour is on or off so paired conditions share the
same start and the same wind.
